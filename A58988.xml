            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The SECOND PART OF D<seg rend="sup">r.</seg> SHERLOCK'<seg rend="sup">s</seg> Two Kings OF BRAINFORD.</head>
            <p>WHere a Man is charged with Ill Intention, or such Consequences as no Pretence of Good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention can Justifie; a Vindication is most proper for himself: for if any part of the Charge is too true to be answered, it may be lessen'd by a Protestation, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd for the Ingenuity of a Confession. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> has indeed protested, that he intended not to reflect upon this Government as an Usurpation, but I think this has been shewn to be contrary to the plain Fact.</p>
            <p>Himself says in his Preface,<note place="margin">Pref. <hi>p.</hi> last.</note>
               <hi>In managing this Argument upon the Principles he has laid down, it is necessary to reason upon Supposition of unjust Æ²surpations, and Illegal Revolutions of State.</hi> And indeed this way of arguing was necessary to justifie his Swearing Allegiance; for if his Principles are true, our Government was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Usurpation, and the Revolution Illegal; tho he drops
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50740:3"/> some Expressions contrary to his avowed Principles; he by no means applies them to the Justifying the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only to warrant our Submission to it: if he says any thing which may in consequence prove this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be no Usurpation; it is plainly contrary to the confess'd Intention of his Book; and did he believe our Revolution justifiable, he ought first to have proved it so, before he admitted the dangerous Supposition that it is not so.</p>
            <p>This the Law of Argument had required, if he had been of an Opinion consisting with the Honour and Safety of this Government: Not having done it, but on the other side, shewing that the Ground of his Scruple was, that he thought Usurpers were not to be obeyed; and that it was removed, by being taught, that Usurpers are to be obeyed: What does he less than loudly proclaim their Majesties Usurpers?</p>
            <p>He may, if he please, slight and contemn the Objection; for my part I cannot so far undervalue the Wit of his <hi>Vindicator,</hi> as not publickly to clear my self from his Charge,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 34. <hi>page</hi> 35.</note> of being a <hi>Malicious Slanderer of the Doctor,</hi> guilty of <hi>wickedly wresting his Sense, falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Words,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 37.</note> and <hi>most Religiously,</hi> that is, most irreligiously, <hi>bringing Objections against the very Scriptures:</hi> because I do not take them in the Doctor's Sense.</p>
            <p>Were it not for these Groundless Imputations, I should have slighted the Peevish Quarrel at my Stile, and the Title which I chose, as expressive of the Doctor's Characters of Two Kings; one who is supposed to have <hi>Legal Right</hi> to the Government, and yet none to the Allegiance of the Subject; they not owing any to him, till he regains it by Disturbing the Present Peace and Settlement made by God himself. Another admitted to have Right to the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance of the Subject, and yet that this is without <hi>Legal Right</hi> to the Government; tho he is fully submitted to by the People, and in Conjunction with them, or with their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50740:3"/> consent, has Power of making Laws which may change all <hi>Legal Rights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether another Title might in fewer words have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented this to the mind, is not worth a Contest: and had there been no more than Mirth in his Charges, I might have suffered him to <hi>indulge</hi> his Spleen at the supposed <hi>Laskity</hi> or Mercinariness of a <hi>Pen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 38.</note> which perhaps I may say, without Vanity, has been given up to the Cause of my Country; and tho I have no reason to boast of my Gains in its Service, I hope no Misfortunes shall make me repent of those Endeavours which I have dedicated to it: nor durst I betray it, so much, as by my silence, how much soever Interest, or Importunity might have pleaded in Excuse. If others of greater Abilities, and less interrupted Studies, had as often thought themselves under the like Obligation, it might have set aside mine. I must needs say, I am very sorry to have any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie with a Gentleman who expresses a Zeal for this Government: but I should be much sorryer, if his writing against me should prove a piece of Service to it.</p>
            <p>But he who pays <hi>Service</hi> to that, while he has a <hi>Veneration for the Doctor;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page 28.</hi> Which I have undertaken as a piece of Service to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as out of Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Doctor.</note> may think he serves it, when he makes its Honour and Establishment subservient to the Reputation of the Man whom he <hi>Venerates.</hi> Some would think that he unluckily transposes the Romish use of ÏÎ±ÏÏÎµÎ¯Î± and Î´Î¿ÏÎ»ÎµÎ¯Î±, paying the highest Honour to the inferior Nature.</p>
            <p>I may well say it is not unusual for Bigottry, or a forbidden Admiration of Persons, to enervate Mens Faculties, corrupt their Judgments, and divert that Noble Ardour, with which they should prosecute the common Enemies, to their Country, and to Mankind.</p>
            <p>It is certainly very unhappy, for any to be so blinded with Passion or Affection, as not to be able to discern Friends from Foes; to engage against their own Party
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50740:4"/> and Interest; and to support those who would destroy them, but could not, without their being Accessary to their own Ruine: the Excess of Truth in this Matter, forbids the Satyr of the Application.</p>
            <p>But surely this Gentleman's Quarrel is very unreasonable against me, who am his Friend, as I am, or would be, to every Body who comes in to this Government upon such Principles, as may make Allegiance more certain than the Chance of War; and less precarious than the Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> even as now maintained, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
            <p>If that just Indignation, which I have conceived, against those false Colours, with which some would bedawb and spoil the natural Beauties of this <hi>Revolution,</hi> may at any time have warm'd my thoughts; I hope it has no where transported me to any indecent Expressions: and if my words are <hi>Froth</hi> for want of weight;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 28.</note> I know not that I have given occasion, for the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison to a Wild-Boar <hi>Whetting his Tusks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ibid.</note> or a <hi>Wild Reflecter upon the established National Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 40.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this <hi>Gentleman</hi> shall see that I can be Temperate in every thing concerning my self, and how ill soever he treats me, I am resolved to use him well; because I believe him to be a Friend to our Constitution and Settlement; and that he differs from me only where he misunderstands me.</p>
            <p>I shall calmly shew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he for the most part agrees with me, and where he materially differs, he differs from himself as much as from me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Doctor materially differs from him and me and that I had reason to except anainst the Doctor's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as, by manifest Consequence, 1. Charging the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in the late <hi>Revolution,</hi> with <hi>Rebellion</hi> against that Power which he had taught to be irresistible in all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50740:4"/> Cases. And 2. Their Majesties with <hi>Æ²surpation.</hi> 3. That by like Consequence, he <hi>too plainly invites the late King once more to try his Fortune.</hi> And 4. Does not free himself from, at least, bordering upon <hi>Blasphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That those Expressions, wherein the Doctor agrees with me, are Departures from his <hi>Principles;</hi> and that the Propositions with which I concluded, and which this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman receives for true Principles, are every one of them contrary to the Doctor's.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And tho it may seem needless, after proof of the other Heads, I shall remove all the seemingly material Objections against my Expressions, or that Sense in which I have taken Scripture, or the Doctor's Words.</p>
            <p n="1">I. This <hi>Gentleman</hi> confesses,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 19.</note> that <hi>the Notions of Passive Obedience and Non-resistance, have been much abused, and strain'd, perhaps, much farther than the Law of God or Man intended 'em. But,</hi> says he, <hi>take them in a right Sense, and I believe few Christians will oppose 'em; all owning that private Persons are not to resist Authority, or disturb the State they live in: and that when no notable Inconvenience follows, any Mischief, is much better than War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more fully, <hi>both Law and Gospel,</hi> says he,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 23.</note>
               <hi>condemn Resistance of our Lawful Superiors, but neither, that I know, give any direction how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, supposing all overturn'd, the Laws vacated, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment changed, and in respect of what it was before, entirely dissolved, not being willing to suppose any such things should happen, which if they do, by their not taking particular care of those cases, they seem to leave a Man to the direction of common Prudence, and Self-preservation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein he effectually justifies the <hi>Revolution</hi> upon the late King's <hi>vacating the Laws,</hi> &amp;c. and I make no other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to his Notion, than that it too much Favours a Common-wealth Principle: whereas I think I have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50740:5"/> shewn how the Law preserves <hi>the Monarchy,</hi> notwithstanding the Dissolution of the Contract,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the English Government.</note> or other Obligation between the Prince and People.</p>
            <p>But yet he will have it, that <hi>the Law does not deny</hi> such Prince <hi>his Right to the Crown,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page.</hi> 34.</note> even after the Law, which he owns to have given it him, was <hi>vacated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, he will have it to remain, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what he calls <hi>the Acquists and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a just War:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 31.</note> but having admonish'd the Doctor of the want of Policy in such Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Two Kings,</hi> p. 38.</note> I shall leave this Gentleman to think better of it. And I believe the World will think, that he had no reason to except against my Notions, when he not only receives my <hi>Scheme</hi> of Government, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it almost in every Line to be the Doctor's; but,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 40. <hi>page</hi> 35.</note> with me, owns that a Prince may Usurp upon his Subjects, and that the late King was such an Usurper:<note place="margin">Tyranny or Æ²sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation upon Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Two Kings. <hi>p. 20.</hi>
               </note> Speaking of times, <hi>When the Law has its due course, and the Government not as good as totally overturned,</hi> He says, <hi>If things be once in that condition, and the Prince is [an Æ²surper on that part of Power which is distinct from him,] and wherewith the Law, which the Doctor tells us, is the measure of our Obedience, never intrusted him; In this case [which was plainly ours] as not concerning him, he does not meddle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then he effectually sets aside all the Doctor's pains to bring the 13th to the <hi>Romans</hi> to require Submission to Usurpation; for grafting upon my Argument, <hi>If,</hi> says he,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 36.</note>
               <hi>Natural Power be Force, and Moral Power Law, the King</hi> de Facto <hi>is possessed of both, and there is no need of the Distinction;</hi> but surely there is to shew, that the Doctor mistakes the Text.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50740:5"/>
            <p>He as effectually sets aside the use the Doctor has of the Text, to make Tyrants irresistible; for upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's asserting that Sovereign Princes are not to be resisted, which he all along applies to <hi>England,</hi> where he owns that the Law has set Bounds to the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> of the Prince; <hi>Indeed,</hi> says our Author,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 35.</note>
               <hi>where a Prince has the absolute Sovereignty, and entire Authority, few, I suppose, will deny him to be in the right; since where such Authority is, the Authoritative Acts thereof are Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Gentleman himself holds this not to be the case of an English King; for he owns he may be said to usurp upon part of the Power with which the Law never trusted him. And will have it,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>It seems, to our comfort, the Doctor was all this while laboring the case of a French, not of an English King; but it may appear, That he is far from receiving this Gentleman's Sense of Sovereignty, and of Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>part</hi> of it: nor will he with his Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, say, that the <hi>Supream Power of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the King and Parliament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 24, 25.</note> or as he soon explains it, <hi>King, Lords and Commons:</hi> according to this, if Gods Authority, tho in a lower Degree, is in Lords and Commons; and if, as the Doctor has it,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Every one who exerciseth Supream Power, is from God,</hi> and his Person is Irresistible, then the Persons of Lords and Commons are <hi>Irresistible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That the Doctor does materially differ from him and me, and that I had reason to charge him as I did, is very evident, even from this Book which this Gentleman under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to defend; but had it not appear'd plainly here, I think it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50740:6"/> were very allowable for me to prove it out of his Case of Resistance,<note place="margin">page <hi>28.</hi> Taking to task not only the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's present book but those already past.</note> where he purposely treats of the Case of Tyranny; as he here does of a supposed Usurpation: And this, surely, I am very well warranted to do, after the Doctor had said,</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pref.</hi> p. ante pen.</note>
               <hi>I must add one thing more, That I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced no Principle that ever I taught, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one in the Case of Resistance, which is the only mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Passage I have any reason to retract in that Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. But even in the last Book he holds, contrary to his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">page <hi>48. Vid.</hi> page <hi>45.</hi> A great Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice rather than an Objection. page <hi>48.</hi>
               </note> and that in express terms, That the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Duty and Conscience,</hi> are not only <hi>Prejudices,</hi> but <hi>Objections</hi> against our late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution: His words are these,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King</hi> James, <hi>more, I hope, by following ill Counsels, than by his own Inclination, had effectually removed all Prejudices and Objections against such a Revolution, [excepting the Obligation of Duty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.]</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note>These Obligations being excepted, I appeal to this Gentleman, whether he can, agreeably to the Doctor, say, That King <hi>James</hi> did either <hi>Forego or Forfeit</hi> his Right.</p>
            <p>Nay, whereas the Gentleman owns the Law, requiring Allegeance to the late King, vacated before the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; let him see whether the Doctor does not charge the Instruments in the Revolution with Perjury: <hi>We must not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 22.</note> says he, <hi>contrary to our Sworn Duty and Allegiance, promote such Revolutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 30.</note>And elsewhere says, by <hi>Swearing to the Heirs, and Legal or Lawful Successors,</hi> we do not <hi>Swear to own or submit to any Prince,</hi> who is not the <hi>Legal Heir;</hi> but <hi>we Swear, not to make it our act; not to set up any Prince, who is not the right Heir.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50740:6"/>
            <p>Let this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> if he pleases, say I am a <hi>Malicious Slanderer</hi> of the Doctor, in saying, that herein he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns all those as guilty of <hi>willful Perjury,</hi> who had been Subjects to the <hi>late King,</hi> and were Instruments in setting up This.</p>
            <p>That they did not adhere to the <hi>Strictest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Loyalty and Obedience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 16.</note> is a Censure not worth the mentioning after this: But <hi>according to those Principles,</hi> the Doctor says, <hi>Men are to have no hand in such Revolutions, or to oppose them as far as they can; and not to be hasty and forward in their Compliances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Genleman admits, that the Scripture provides not for the Irresistibility of any Prince, who has not the <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sovereignty, and such entire Authority as makes Laws,</hi> which he denies to belong to the King of <hi>England.</hi>
               <note place="margin">True Vin. pag. <hi>24, 25</hi> page <hi>30.</hi> page <hi>43.</hi>
               </note> But the Doctor says, of such a Sovereign Prince, as he supposes ours to be, that he <hi>is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by Force,</hi> and <hi>that his Subjects must reverence God's Authority in him, and submit to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Resistance, though they are ill used.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This Gentleman agrees our present Settlement to be no <hi>Æ²surpation;</hi> that the late King was the <hi>Æ²surper</hi> upon his Subjects;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 35.</note> and that they justly chose a Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but the Doctor, as I shall shew more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly than I have already observed, says, that, by the unforc'd Consequence of which, their Majesties must be <hi>Æ²surpers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, whereas I have maintained by <hi>Law,</hi> that <hi>their Majesties are Rightful King and Queen, and came by their Power by due means;</hi> I here take up the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator's</hi> Challenge, and shall shew <hi>where the Doctor affirms</hi> what is <hi>contrary to this:</hi> and then I hope,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note> tho this <hi>Gentleman</hi> will have it, that he does not say in terms or <hi>Consequence,</hi> that <hi>their Majesties are Æ²surpers;</hi> all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byassed Men, to whom only I appeal, will say, that I <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve not the name of a Malicious Slanderer.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50740:7"/>
            <p>Tho this <hi>Gentleman</hi> seems disposed to dispute every thing which I shall affirm of the Doctor, he will not, I dare say, deny that the Doctor admits the <hi>late King</hi> once to have been our <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Rightful</hi> Governour; and must allow that he was so declared in <hi>the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> taken to him. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If neither the Subjects, nor any Foreign Prince, could upon the account of any Injuries he did the Subjects, contribute towards the Revolution, according to the Doctor, without Sin; but the Revolution was <hi>Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> and Act; and yet Gods Interposition did not take away the Right.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the late King could not Lose or Forfeit it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or if he could, yet did not.</p>
            <p>If any one of these Cases are received by the Doctor, upon the Subject of our Debate, much more if all of them are, I think it will not be denied, but that in plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, of what the Doctor says, <hi>their Majesties</hi> cannot but be <hi>Æ²surpers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Doctor allows the Subjects in no case to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to such a Revolution, has appeared already: and if he makes Revolutions so much <hi>Gods Prerogative,</hi> that no Man whatever can, without Sin, act before God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself by the Event; then he condemns the Foreign Prince, who Delivers a People, as well as them who Sue for the Deliverance.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 43.</note> But he says, that the <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Government are Gods Prerogative, the changing of Government he keeps in his own hand:</hi> And tho he speaks it there, in reference to the Subjects Duty, he before had in all cases confin'd the Right of bringing them about to <hi>Gods Providence;</hi> which he makes the sole <hi>Foundation</hi> of Government.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 24.</note>
               <hi>I cannot,</hi> says he, <hi>see where to fix the Foundation of Government, but in the Providence of God.</hi> And tho he speaks of several ways, whereby God uses to change or fix Governments, he excepts against the effect of <hi>Choice, Conquest, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50740:7"/> Æ²surpation, Continuance</hi> of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 13.</note> and even <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> it self; and imputes the Change solely to the Authority of God, made known by the <hi>Events of Providence;</hi> and yet makes that Authority not to give a <hi>Right:</hi> for that Providence, which, with him, is the sole Foundation of Government, he says,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 56.</note>
               <hi>alters no legal Right;</hi> but whoever is set up by Providence, while a Right remains unaltered in another Prince, must, one would think, needs be an <hi>Æ²surper.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 33.</note> And he will not allow, that any Ambitious Prince can <hi>grasp at a Crown, or invade his Neighbour, without a Dose of Enthusiasm. For,</hi> says he, <hi>if the Kingdoms of the World be disposed by God, and no Art or Power can place any Prince on the Throne, but by Gods appointment; unless they can flatter themselves, that God has ordained them to be Kings, it will check their Ambitious Attempts, which God can so easily defeat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which we may add what he says in the next Page; <hi>Tho Kingdoms are disposed by God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 34.</note>
               <hi>yet Princes may be advanced,</hi> to Gods Authority by his Gift, <hi>by no Honester Means than Thieves take a Purse, or break open my House, and take my Money or Goods.</hi> What Prince would thank the Doctor, for allowing him <hi>God's</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon these Terms?</p>
            <p>But if God alone, without any consent of the People, disposes of the Kingdom, and such disposition cannot alter the Right, without their consent, nor indeed with, as the Doctor argues, making no such Submission, in concurrence with Providence, to alter the Right; then it seems the Invading Prince does, and must, continue an Usurper, till he gains a <hi>Submission</hi> from the Dispossessed Prince: Which he says,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note>
               <hi>Indeed may be thought necessary to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Legal Right.</hi> But he who wants any thing necessary to have a Legal Right to a Crown transferred to him, is certainly an Usurper. Nay, the Doctor will have that Prince, who has not obtained his necessary Translation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50740:8"/> of Legal Right, to continue an Usurper, even after the Death of the Dispossessed Prince; for his words are these:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 24.</note>
               <hi>An Æ²surper by long Continuance, may outlive those who formerly wore the Crown; but does it give Right to him who has none, that he Outlives those who had the Right? For tho no body else has any Right to the Crown, how does this make him a Rightful King, who has no Right?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The late King could not upon the Doctor's Principles, Lose or Forfeit that Right which he once had. This appears not only from his urging the Necessity of the <hi>Prince his Submission, to transfer</hi> that Right which he once had; but from the Nature of that Authority which he is by him supposed to have had, and the way by which he came to it: For if it be <hi>Gods Authority,</hi> and of his immediate Gift, then indeed he cannot Forfeit, or Lose it to Men: And since God himself, by taking it away, does not <hi>alter his Right;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 26.</note> the Right is, and ever must be the same, till God, by a Miracle, declares his Will,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 200.</note> that it should be altered: And if this be a Doubt upon his late Case of Allegiance, the Case of Resistance says, the <hi>Sovereign Power is inseparable from his Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If the <hi>late King</hi> might have Lost or Forfeited his Authority; yet it is evident, that according to the Doctor, he did not. I will own to the Vindicator, that the Doctor no where says, that a Prince may not Forfeit or Forego his Right; but I think the plain Consequence of what he holds, is, that the Prince cannot <hi>Forfeit</hi> it: Indeed he admits he may <hi>Forego</hi> it, but that is, by a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission not yet made. As I before observed, in shewing, that he condemned the Revolution; he makes Conscience and Duty Exceptions to it, and that King <hi>James</hi> did not remove those Exceptions: according to which, and the whole drift of his Book, Conscience obliges Men still to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50740:8"/> pay him all that Duty which they can in Consistency with Self-preservation. King <hi>James</hi> being named by himself, in reference to the Revolution, I think it is no Force, upon his meaning, to say, he is the dispossessed Prince, whose Legal Right he will have not to be alter'd; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he makes to be due to a dispossessed Prince, who has Legal Right, he makes due to King <hi>James:</hi> Let the World judge of the Consequences of the following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He makes it our Duty to <hi>take care,</hi> that we pray for him who is in Possession, <hi>under the Name and Title of King; in such Terms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 17.</note>
               <hi>as not to Pray against the Dispossessed Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He says, we must not deny the Disposs'd Prince his <hi>Just Right:</hi> but the Possession, it seems,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 26.</note> is not in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>ur Hands: and, one would think, that since he so boldly Insinuates the other's Right, he would have their Majesties Resign.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he may Fight to Regain the Possession.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is Doubtful, whether in such case he may not Commissionate his Old Subjects to Fight for him; For, says the Doctor,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 31.</note>
               <hi>I am not Lawyer enough to decide, whether a Commission granted by a King out of Possession, be a Legal Commission.</hi> But as I before shewed, if it were not <hi>Legal</hi> in Form, it would, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him, have <hi>the Authority of Sovereign Power;</hi> and all the Support and Comfort which he leaves the deserted Prince in Possession, in such case, is, that no <hi>Law,</hi> that the Doctor knows, <hi>requires all Subjects to receive Commissions,</hi> either from the other, or from him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 31.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. As he no where says, what implies in the least, that the Subject may assist the King in Possession, when the other Fights against him; He rather shews it to be his Opinion, that the Subjects may not Fight on the side of the Possession,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 17.</note>
               <hi>while the Dispessessed Prince has also such a Formidable Power, as makes the Event very
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50740:9"/> Doubtful.</hi> For in such cases he will have the <hi>Degree of Submission</hi> to <hi>This</hi> to be abated: And his Answer to the Objection,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 26.</note>
               <hi>That it is unjust for Subjects to pay Allegiance, while another has legal right and claim to the Throne,</hi> Shews, that he allows them to pay Allegiance, only while the <hi>other don't and can't Govern,</hi> for want of Power.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That they who are under no Obligation to the Prince in Possession, are not forbid to assist the Dispossessed Prince to recover his legal right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, by direct Consequence, if his be the Cause of Right and Justice, they are oblig'd to assist him, as they have Opportunity; and no doubt this was Publish'd to strengthen the Confederacy against <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What will Foreign Princes think, if a Divine of our Church, who takes the Oaths to their Majesties, shall be known to have Written thus? No doubt but the French King will take care to have his Book Translated into their Language.</p>
            <p>I hope henceforward this Vindicator will not be so free in his Censures,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 34.</note> and will own the <hi>Disloyal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences</hi> in the Doctors Book are the Doctor's own, not of my making: However, I think, this may shew, That I was far from being a <hi>Malicious Slanderer,</hi> when out of Service to the Government, I exposed those Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And, perhaps, the Gentleman will not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so sure,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 30.</note>
               <hi>That there is little Ground</hi> for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that the Doctor <hi>too plainly invites the late King once more to try his Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Vindicator says of me, <hi>Let him prove the Absurdity, and Blasphemy, of those Principles, on which the Doctor proceeds in his Book, and he shall quickly have either a Confession, or an Answer.</hi> He that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern the Proofs of the Absurdity, of Notions which himself Rejects, shall never engage me upon that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50740:9"/> Head. As for <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> I had no where expressly charged it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 4.</note> but qualified it with a <hi>perhaps;</hi> and the full exposal of that, I had referred to the <hi>Divine.</hi> But when I came to touch upon what looks that way,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 24.</note> I thought I was very gentle; when I said, <hi>I do not well know by what Term to call it, but shall fairly represent it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Gentleman makes me a very Civil return for my Moderation herein: tho I forbear to charge the Doctor with <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> he charges me with denying the Authority of the Scriptures, which I am sure I never did. His words are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He blames the Doctor for affirming the Scripture never speaks of the bare Permission of Events,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 36, 37.</note>
               <hi>but represents God, as the Author of all the Good and Evil which happens to Societies and Persons. Which,</hi> says he, <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he'd have answered, by instancing where it did:</hi> But instead of that, he <hi>wisely Reasons against Matter of Fact, and most Religiously brings Objections against the very Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the Authority of which, at least, being, I hope, from God, we may take the Truth of it for granted, and wave any farther answer; especially when the Robber's Case has been already considered.</hi> I know not that I have any where spoken so doubtfully of the Authority of Scriptures, as this Gentleman, in <hi>but hoping,</hi> that they are from <hi>God:</hi> For I believe that they are: and surely Faith has an higher Degree of Assurance than Hope.</p>
            <p>But, as in many other Particulars, all the Force which lyes in this Gentleman's Objection against me, is by changing a Word for the Doctor and me, and putting in <hi>represents,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>makes.</hi> If the Scriptures, as the Doctor says, <hi>makes</hi> God the Author of all Evil which happens in a City; tho it might seem difficult to the Understanding, Faith must yield to the Authority; but if it only <hi>represents</hi> God <hi>as</hi> the Author; then it does not follow, that we must believe him to be the Author: But Reason would carry us from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50740:10"/> the Literal Sense, to some other, fully suitable to that Idea which we have of a Being Infinite in all Perfections. But unless this Gentleman believes Transubstantion, I hope he will not say, that I disbelieve the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I receive not the Literal Meaning in some places; as where it represents God with Passions, nay, Body Humane.</p>
            <p>If I <hi>argue</hi> against Matter of Fact in this, I am sure he must against Common Sense; if he will in no case allow the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be taken in any other than a strict literal Meaning: And the Doctor himself argued against Fact, as much as I do, when he said of Usurping Rebels,<note place="margin">Case of Ref. page <hi>128.</hi>
               </note> such <hi>Men get Power into their Hands by Gods Permission, not by Gods Ordinance.</hi>

                  <hi>p.</hi> 34.</note>He waves, he says, <hi>any farther Answer; when the Robber's Case has been already considered.</hi> My Objections upon the Supposition of Gods giving the Crown authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively to an Usurper, supposed to be an Usurper, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding such Gift; would not be answered, if he could shew, upon the Doctor's Principles, that God may be said to Authorize Usurpations, but not Robberies.</p>
            <p>But what says this Gentleman to the Objection from the Parallel?<note place="margin">True Vind. page <hi>25.</hi>
               </note> the most he says is, you may turn to the Doctor's <hi>Book, and see it answered before it was made;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two Kings page <hi>25.</hi>
               </note> but he does not take notice of the meer Evasion shewn to lye in the pretended Answer?</p>
            <p>This Gentleman thinks the Substance of the Answer to lye in this; <hi>There is pure Force for the Destruction of Civil Order, without any Agreement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his mentioning Civil Order, one would think, that instead of speaking of Robberies, he speaks of Usurpations, <hi>without any Agreement:</hi> Is not the want of Agreement of the Party usurp'd upon, equally supposed? How then does this difference the case? Till this Gentleman shews a more material difference, it will not be said, that the Doctor has taught what obviates my Objection. He would have it, that I, in saying that <hi>Publick Good may require the Establishment</hi> of one who had Usurp'd, yield a material difference between his case and a Robber's: But,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50740:10"/>1. If Publick Good required this at the beginning, and the proper Judges of the Publick Good declared so; he whom the Doctor supposes to be an Usurper, never was one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the time of such Declaration, he would cease to be an Usurper, if he were one before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If he assumed the Government without this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctor, he might have done it by as ill means as a Robber robs my House: wherefore what I said there, does not in the least weaken the Parallel.</p>
            <p>And he who says,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 34.</note> as the Doctor does expresly, That a Prince may be advanced to a Throne, <hi>by no Honester Means, than Thieves take my Purse, or break open my House, and take my Money and Goods;</hi> and yet will allow of <hi>no distinction,</hi> in reference to a Man's mounting the Throne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 12.</note> between <hi>what God permits, and what he does;</hi> as I conceive, <hi>charges God as foolishly,</hi> as if he should say, God is Accessary to Robberies. And let the Doctor, if he pleases, clear himself.</p>
            <p>It may already, pretty well appear,<note place="margin">Vid. True Vind. <hi>p 37.</hi>
               </note> that I did not <hi>Transcribe</hi> out of the Doctor, when I was arguing against him; and justifying God Almighty, by shewing, that a Literal Sense was no more to be put upon those Texts, which would make God the Author of Usurpations; than a like Text, which, if taken Literally, as I am perswaded it ought not, would make him to have appointed those very Bounds which are gotten by Violence and Injustice.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But this Gentleman has a Passage, which would bring the Doctor and me together more than I am aware of.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 17.</note>This Gentleman might have observed, that I had asserted, and endeavoured to prove, that if the Doctor would, in all cases, yield, <hi>as entire Obedience to the King of Providence, as he did to the Legal King; he had learn'd this from Principles directly contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Passive Obedience and Non-resistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 28.</note>I had shewn farther, that if the Doctor <hi>had pursued, as he ought, those true Principles which he sometimes falls upon unawares; he would have given the World more Satisfaction of his Sincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Vindicator</hi> being resolved to write against me, as it should seem before he had read all my Book, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to maintain</hi> against me from the <hi>Doctor's Book,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 29.</note>
               <hi>and what is there asserted either in express terms or fair consequences,</hi> That their present Majesties, <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary, are rightful King and Queen of these Realms, and came by their power by due means;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 4.</note> which I say is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to <hi>be proved upon the Doctor's Grounds.</hi> But when I came to shew where the Doctor, departing from his Grounds, lets fall Expressions, which, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of them were duely pursued, would fully justifie Their Majesties and the Revolution; This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman falls into a Passion, and says, I <hi>surreptitiously prevented him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 38.</note> that is, I prevented his Answer, when he wanted but three Pages to finish; and that surely was great pity.</p>
            <p>But if the Doctor's Grounds or the Principles which he lays down, are contrary to Their Majesties Right; if the Expressions which he uses, contrary to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, are never applied to justifie their Right, but barely for the Justification of himself and other Subjects, in Swearing and paying Allegiance; if, farther, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of his whole Book appears to be contrary to those Expressions; then I think, till this Gentleman can prevail
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50740:11"/> upon the <hi>Doctor</hi> to renounce those Principles which so long kept him from swearing Allegiance, and still with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him from justifying the Government; he cannot say that he has justified his Swearing, upon such Principles as prove the Right, as well as Possession of the Crown, to be in Their Majesties. Wherefore I must still call upon him, as he values the interest of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> to which Their Majesties are the greatest support; as he values the Obligation for that great indulgence and benignity which has been shewn him; as he values the Liberties of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, which suffer none to halt between two Opinions in this matter, (especially since he yields, that many things have been said <hi>to justifie the legality of the late Revolution,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>page</hi> 2.</note>
               <hi>which may make Men more modest in the point</hi>) to read those Books, which treat of it, with that judgment which he applies to other things; and then I doubt not but he will pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish such a Recantation, as shall make full amends for the mischief which his Book may do, with unwary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Minds.</p>
            <p>When the Doctor has considered better, then I hope, he may receive and illustrate the Propositions which I had rais'd, with the Approbation of the Vindicator: but at present, if I may judge by the Doctor's Books, he differs widely from them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>He might have taken Notice that the Objection is, that, tho the King <hi>de Facto</hi> has God's Authority, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him, with whom he supposes the Right to be, to fight against that Authority.</p>
            <p>But is it against our Law, or against the King <hi>de Facto,</hi> that he should be Warranted to defend his Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; And that it shall not be thought, that God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the other to fight for the Possession?

               </note> whereas the Doctor says, the King out of Possession ought <hi>by the Laws of the Land to be King:</hi> But if the Law, and <hi>God s Authority,</hi> be on the side of the Possessor, has not he the right, and no other?

            <p n="3">3. To my Third, he says, <hi>There is no question but God designs to take away his Gift when he actually does it.</hi> Which Answer would justifie all prosperous Rebellions.</p>
            <p>What I say further, upon the Doctors allowing, that the Dispossess'd Prince may fight against one to whom God has given his Crown, I think may be left to shift for its self, being answered at the same rate.</p>
            <p>But it concerns me to free my self from the charge of so foul an <hi>Abuse</hi> put upon the <hi>Doctor, as never was Fowler,</hi> where he represents me saying,<note place="margin">True Vind. page <hi>33.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>the Doctor Interprets that part of the Canon,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any Man affirm, that</hi> Jaddus, <hi>having Sworn Allegiance to</hi> Darius, <hi>might have borne Arms against him, he doth greatly Err; in this manner,</hi> the meaning <hi>is no more than this, that he having Sworn Allegiance to</hi> Darius, <hi>could not have made a voluntary Dedition of himself to</hi> Darius.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50740:15"/>
            <p>But the best of it is, there is no one Observation of his, which may seem to deserve an answer, wherein he takes my words as they lye: And it would be strange, if I, having tax'd the Doctor with leaving out those words, and compared it to the Omission of a part of <hi>Bracton,</hi> which explained <hi>Bracton</hi>'s meaning, contrary to what the <hi>Doctor</hi> render'd it; should say, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> puts an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon words, of which I say he gives no account at all.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Doctor</hi> had affirmed, that <hi>the Canon takes no notice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case of Alleg. page <hi>8.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>that</hi> Jaddus, <hi>having Sworn to</hi> Darius, <hi>could not submit or Swear to any other Prince while</hi> Darius <hi>lived.</hi> And instead of explaining the whole Canon, he undertook to explain what <hi>Jaddus</hi> meant, when he said he could not Swear to <hi>Alexander, while</hi> Darius <hi>lived, because of his Oath to</hi> Darius. Upon this he had put a strein'd Sense, that he could not Swear till he should be forced to it; but since he had been bound to take notice of that part of the Canon, which I observ'd; it was not improper to represent that way, in which he would explain <hi>Jadus</hi> his meaning, as an Art to turn off the Observation of that part of the Canon: for every Body must confess what he says of <hi>a voluntary Dedition,</hi> would be very Foreign to that part of the Canon which says, <hi>If any Man affirm,</hi>

            <p>Where, I say, <hi>when our Saviour and his Apostles gave Rules about Subjection, there was no Competition [between Princes or Powers] about Rights or Titles to Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This in truth he admits, but leaves out <hi>[Princes or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers]</hi> and fights with his own Proposition; but surely, take it even as himself makes it, he had no reason to ask, <hi>where was my History, or Memory</hi> upon this? for <hi>Despisers of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and the ungovernable <hi>Gnosticks</hi> or Jews could not be called Competitors or Rivals for Power with the <hi>Romans.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> and I should not differ, did he, with that <hi>Discerning Author,</hi> yield; 1.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> The Consequence of the Breach of a mutual Contract: 2. That the asking the Peoples Consent, is not a vain Ceremony at Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: 3. That the most <hi>invidious Condition,</hi> is implied in a Political or State Contract, as well as in the Matrimonial. 4. That there was such a Contract between the late King
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50740:19"/> and his Subjects. 5. That there was a Breach on his side.</p>
            <p>In short, his business is not to justifie the <hi>Doctor,</hi> but the <hi>Revolution;</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> is for himself, not for the <hi>Revolution.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But say some, they are no Friends to the Government, who write against the <hi>Doctor;</hi> who shews that Men may submit to this Government, notwithstanding the Prejudice against it, from that share which the People had in setling it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In Answer to which, I desire these Particulars may be well considered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is enough to remove the <hi>Prejudice,</hi> not only against Submission, but even the <hi>Revolution</hi> it self; that the <hi>Doctor,</hi> with all his strength of Invention, cannot shut out the People; but by condemning God's Instruments in all cases, in bringing about the greatest Blessings to Mankind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Without Blemishing the <hi>Divine Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If this be a Prejudice with any against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to have it thought an Usurpation would be a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> with more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Government settled by a National Consent, need never fear them who are prejudiced against that Cosnent; if they who were for it, may be admitted to defend it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If they who have this Prejudice, seemingly come in to this Government, they are but the better enabled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it; and as the Belief of Right in Governours restrains the Multitude, who have the most strength, from taking the Power into their own Hands; whenever the strength of the Nation is in the Hands of them, who believe King <hi>James</hi> to have the <hi>Right;</hi> according to their own Principles they will be bound to recall him.</p>
